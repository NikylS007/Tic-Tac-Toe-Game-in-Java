# Tic Tac Toe Game in Java

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in Java using the Java programming language. The game is played on a 3x3 grid where two players, X and O, take turns marking the grid with their respective symbols. The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all 9 squares are filled and there is no winner, the game is a draw.
